  abstract = {OpenCitations is an infrastructure organization for open scholarship dedicated to the publication of open citation data as Linked Open Data using Semantic Web technologies, thereby providing a disruptive alternative to traditional proprietary citation indexes. Open citation data are valuable for bibliometric analysis, increasing the reproducibility of large-scale analyses by enabling publication of the source data. Following brief introductions to the development and benefits of open scholarship and to Semantic Web technologies, this paper describes OpenCitations and its data sets, tools, services, and activities. These include the OpenCitations Data Model; the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies; OpenCitations' open software of generic applicability for searching, browsing, and providing REST APIs over resource description framework (RDF) triplestores; Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs) and the OpenCitations OCI Resolution Service; the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), a database of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data made available in RDF under a Creative Commons public domain dedication; and the OpenCitations Indexes of open citation data, of which the first and largest is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref Open DOI-to-DOI Citations, which currently contains over 624 million bibliographic citations and is receiving considerable usage by the scholarly community.}

  abstract = {The main topic of this report concerns the formulation of guidelines for PID Managers regarding the creation of a ``user tailored EOSC compliant PID policy.'' Central to the work are the following questions. How can we determine the quality of the EOSC PID policy and - in collaboration with all stakeholders - how can we implement a user tailored PID policy? In other words, what principles, roles and criteria can we distinguish when it comes to the use of PIDs in the EOSC. To answer this question, we need to thoroughly and systematically analyze the PID landscape (of which PID Managers are a part). For this, we are working closely with the FAIRCORE4EOSC project in which a Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT) is being developed. The CAT will support PID Managers and others with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. In total 16 guidelines for formulating PID policies are compiled and presented in the report. On this basis, targeted support can be provided for the formulation of EOSC compliant PID policies as provided by the FAIR-IMPACT project.},
