# Licenses

_Last updated: 2025-06-18_

As the open science movement continues to grow and digital sharing of research outputs becomes standard, **unambiguous identification of licenses** has become essential. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) or resolvable URIs for licenses provide machine-actionable rights information that is crucial for reusability, compliance, and attribution.

Licenses are particularly relevant for:

* Research datasets
* Publications and articles
* Software and code
* Metadata records
* Media files and supplementary materials

Clearly identifying licenses allows for:

* Ensuring legal clarity on reuse conditions
* Enabling automated filtering and access control
* Supporting compliance with funder and institutional policies
* Facilitating discovery and interoperability across systems
* Aiding in reproducibility and reproducible workflows

## International license identifiers and PID systems

### SPDX License List

ðŸŸ¢ Active

The [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) is a standardized list of open source software licenses with unique identifiers, e.g. `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `GPL-3.0-or-later`. Maintained by the Linux Foundation, it is widely adopted in software packaging, GitHub metadata, and compliance tools.

Each license has a short identifier, full name, and canonical URL. SPDX licenses are also referenced in metadata schemas like CodeMeta and Software Heritage.

SPDX is a de facto PID system for software licenses.
