# Handle

_Last updated: 2025-05-08_

The Handle System is a basic PID infrastructure that may be used to create PIDs called _handles_ to refer to generic digital objects, including but not limited to documents, web pages, file archives, structured metadata, etc. Each handle is made up of a numeric prefix and a unique suffix. The handle itself is not designed to contain metadata describing the nature of the object, since its primary purpose is to serve as a transparent link redirecting the user to the target object.

The Handle System is run as a decentralised infrastructure, with locally hosted _Local Handle Services_ being able to create new handles. They are coordinated by the _Global Handle Registry_ administered by the DONA Foundation, which keeps track of handle prefixes. Registering a prefix comes with a yearly fee.

Many infrastructures build upon the Handle System, including several other PID systems. Examples of PIDs built on top of the Handle infrastructure include [DOI](doi.md) and ePIC. This is enabled by infrastructures being accredited as multi-primary administrators for a Handle implementation, making rich customisation possible.
