# Usage context

_Last updated: 2025-11-12_

A persistent identifier system is most often created with a specific use case, or a limited range of use cases, in mind.

The scope may be limited to identification and adressability of a specific type of object or phenomenon. This may f.e. be a specific range of research output types, individuals, organisations, controlled definitions or some other unique and persistently addressable phenomenon.

Examples of clearly scoped PID systems include [ORCID](../data-on-pids/orcid.md), which identifies researchers and other individuals active within the research sector, or [ROR](../data-on-pids/ror.md), which likewise identifies organisations working within the research sector.

Another use case may be creating a PID system to operate within a specific context where not only the type of object itself defines the scope. This may f.e. be when an organisation decides that all versions of documents and files created and managed within their organisational context should be assigned PIDs using an organisational PID system.

Some PID systems are quite generic and do not have a clear scope or delimitation. An example of this is the [Handle](../data-on-pids/handle.md) system, which may be used for generic PID needs, while also being used as a base architecture to build upon for other specialised PID systems with clearly delimited scopes.
