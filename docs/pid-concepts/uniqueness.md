# Uniqueness

_Last updated: 2025-11-17_

Uniqueness, as a PID concept, may be seen as a promise that the PID will remain a unique identifier. This means that the PID will not be reused to point to another digital object. This should be maintained by the [PID Manager](pid-ecosystem.md#manager).

PID uniqueness ensures that references and citations using PIDs will always refer to the digital object intended.

It should however be noted that not all PIDs refer to single objects. A special type of PID, [concept PIDs](concept-pids.md), may in turn refer to many objects at once, each having their own PID.
