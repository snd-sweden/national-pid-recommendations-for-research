# What is a persistent identifier (PID)?

A persistent identifier, or _PID_, is a stable and unique reference assigned to digital object such as a publication, data set, or other digital resource that remains valid indefinitely. PIDs play a crucial role in stable scholarly communication.

Unlike ordinary links or URLs, which can break or change over time, persistent identifiers are designed to endure. They rely on specialized systems that map the identifier to the resourceâ€™s current location. Because PIDs are resolvable online, users can reliably access the resource by always using the identifier, ensuring ongoing availability, discoverability, and citation.

Some PID systems will provide a stable reference to a digital object, but do nothing else. Other PID systems may have additional features, such as making it possible to describe the object with metadata that is disseminated together with the PID.
