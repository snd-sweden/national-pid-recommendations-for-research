For example, a journal article may move to another content management system, or a government document may move to another web server, but the PID for each object would still remain and be usable as a link, redirecting the user to the current target URL of the object.</p> <p>This also means that providing the PID will always be the best option when citing or providing a reference to the digital object.</p> <p>Persistence may also be seen as a promise to govern the long-term accessibility of the digital object by the entity in charge of publishing it, making sure that a valid target URL and correct PID metadata is kept maintained.
