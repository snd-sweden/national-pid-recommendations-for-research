Both sequences include a prefix indicating the source database, such as Wikidata, Crossref, Dryad or OpenCitations. </p> <p>For example, <code>oci:0606622742-06190834283</code> identifies a citation between two resources: The publication with the DOI <code>10.1186/1756-8722-6-59</code> has been cited by the publication with the DOI <code>10.2174/0113816128337881241016064641</code>.
